    <p>Oh, so you're just going to leave me on read? That's ok. 
      No really, that's ok. It doesn't hurt my feelings at all. 
      Not one bit. 
      I mean I'm a nice person and all, and I can understand that maybe you're just not in the mood to talk right now and I'm ok with that.
      I hope leaving me on read took some of the stress out of your day. 
      I hope you feel empowered by neglecting the text that I took the time out of my day to send to you. 
      Do you think I would have sent you that message if I knew you were just going to leave me on read? 
      Was it really that meaningless to you? 
      Do you think I really just sent you that message expecting no response? 
      You're lucky because I'm a really nice person and I won't get worked up about this, but you should really consider the consequences of your actions in the future.
      Just imagine if I did care. 
      Maybe then we'd have a problem on our hands. 
      But no, I'll just let this one slide. 
      Seriously, it's not even that big of a deal and all it shows is that you are a disrespectful and rude person in general. 
      Were you raised by monkeys? 
      What kind of person raises their kids to leave their friends on read? 
      Oh, that's right, your parents did that.
      Well, I hope you know that leaving people on read doesn't actually make you cool and that I can see straight through you, you sack of shit. 
      You dirtbag son of a bitch. 
      Do you think you're funny or something? 
      Because, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but: you aren't fucking funny. 
      And you never will be fucking funny. 
      And to be quite honest with you, I've had enough of your shit. 
      I don't care if I have to come to your house, take your phone and make you type me an adequate response. 
      Do you want that? I don't think so, buddy.
      You left the wrong person on read this time. 
      And don't think I won't because I will and I'll have you know that I have about 25 certified snipers surrounding your house right now and I've told them to shoot at the first sign of movement. 
      Scared? Of course a baby like you would.
